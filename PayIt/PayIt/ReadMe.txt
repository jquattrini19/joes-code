This is an application that keeps track of bills and lets you know when the due dates are within 10 days. When adding a new bill, you only need to add the following:
* Name
* Last Paid Due Date
* Day of Month Due

It may not be obvious how to use all of the features because I wrote it for myself. Maybe some day I will add a user doc.
